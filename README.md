# Fluxpool

Fluxpool is a next-generation Web3 social crypto trading platform, combining real-time trading, social feeds, transparent performance stats, and gamification in a beautiful, responsive interface.

## What is Fluxpool?

Fluxpool is a social trading platform built with Next.js and shadcn/ui. It leverages Privy for authentication, wallet abstraction, and MoonPay-powered fiat onramps, making it easy for anyone to onboard and fund their account using Apple Pay, Google Pay, or cards. Every user gets a unique ENS subname (like `username.fluxpool.eth`) as their onchain identity, which is used for tagging, social features, and connecting with other dApps.

The app fetches new token launches and trending data using The Graphâ€™s Token API, and uses the Uniswap subgraph for historical and trading data. The platform brings together real-time trading, a social feed, transparent stats, and gamification in a seamless, modern web experience.

## Key Features

- **Fiat Onramps**: Fund your account instantly with Apple Pay, Google Pay, or cards via MoonPay integration.
- **ENS Subnames**: Every user gets a unique ENS subname (e.g., `trader.fluxpool.eth`) for onchain identity and social features.
